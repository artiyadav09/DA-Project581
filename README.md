# Customer Segmentation Analysis on Amazon Sales Data

## Overview
This repository contains the SAS scripts and data analysis for the **Customer Segmentation Analysis** project, which uses Amazon Sales Report data to identify customer segments and derive actionable insights for e-commerce marketing strategies. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and clustering techniques using SAS.

## Project Objectives
- Understand customer purchasing behaviors using the Amazon Sales Report dataset.
- Segment customers based on variables such as order amount, quantity, product category, and sales channel.
- Develop insights to guide personalized marketing strategies for improving customer engagement and revenue.

## Dataset
The dataset used is an Amazon Sales Report containing 128,975 entries with 24 variables. Key variables include:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Date**: Date of the order.
- **Amount**: Total amount of the transaction.
- **Qty**: Quantity of items ordered.
- **Category**: Product category (e.g., apparel, electronics).
- **Sales Channel**: Channel through which the sale was made (e.g., Amazon.in, Amazon.com).

## SAS Scripts Included
- **Data Import and Exploration**: Script to import and summarize the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Code to handle missing values and format variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Code for visualizing data (e.g., bar charts for order status distribution).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Script to calculate correlations between key variables (e.g., order amount and quantity).
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implementation of clustering to identify customer segments based on purchasing behavior.

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations such as:
- Order status distribution bar chart.
- Scatter plots depicting customer clusters based on order amount and quantity.

## Usage
To run the analysis, download the SAS scripts and dataset, then follow these steps:
1. Open the SAS scripts in your SAS environment.
2. Execute each section as per the code comments and instructions.
3. Visualize and interpret the outputs as detailed in the scripts.

## Requirements
- SAS software
- Amazon Sales Report dataset

## Results
- Identification of customer segments, including high-value buyers and discount-driven customers.
- Insights into the relationship between order amounts and quantities.
